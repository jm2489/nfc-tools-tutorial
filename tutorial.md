# Configuring an NFC Tag Using NFC Tools

## Introduction
NFC (Near Field Communication) tags are small, programmable chips that can store data and trigger actions when scanned by an NFC-enabled smartphone. The **NFC Tools** app, available on both **iOS** and **Android**, allows users to easily write, read, and manage NFC tags. This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up and writing data to an NFC tag step by step.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following:
- A smartphone with NFC capability (most modern Android and iOS devices support NFC).
- An NFC tag (e.g., NTAG213, NTAG215, NTAG216).
- The **NFC Tools** app installed from the **Google Play Store** (Android) or the **App Store** (iOS).

---

## Step 1: Open the NFC Tools App
1. Launch the **NFC Tools** app on your smartphone.
2. Ensure NFC is enabled on your device:
   - **Android:** Go to **Settings** â†’ **Connected devices** â†’ **NFC** and toggle it **on**.
   - **iPhone:** NFC is automatically enabled on supported devices (iPhone 7 and newer).

## Step 2: Select "Write" Option
1. In the NFC Tools app, tap on the **Write** tab.
2. Select **Add a record** to begin adding data to the NFC tag.

---

## Step 3: Choose a Record Type
The app allows you to store different types of data. Choose the type that best suits your needs:
- **Text** (e.g., a message or note)
- **URL** (e.g., a website link)
- **Phone number** (e.g., a contact or emergency number)
- **Email** (e.g., a pre-filled email template)
- **WiFi** (to share WiFi credentials)

### Example: Writing a Website URL
1. Select **URL/URI**.
2. Enter the website address (e.g., `https://example.com`).
3. Tap **OK** to confirm.

---

## Step 4: Write Data to the NFC Tag
1. Tap **Write / 33 bytes** (the size will vary based on your data).
2. Place your NFC tag near the **back of your phone** (for Android) or **top edge of your iPhone**.
3. Hold it steady until you see a confirmation message stating **Write complete**.

---

## Step 5: Test the NFC Tag
1. Remove and re-tap your phone against the NFC tag.
2. If the write operation was successful, your phone will read the tag and open the stored URL (or perform the stored action).

---

## Additional Features
- **Erase a Tag:** Go to the **Other** tab and select **Erase tag** to remove previously written data.
- **Lock a Tag:** In the **Write** menu, you can permanently lock a tag (cannot be rewritten after locking).
- **Read a Tag:** Use the **Read** option to view existing data on an NFC tag.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Tag Not Detected?** Ensure your phoneâ€™s NFC feature is enabled and hold the tag closer to the correct NFC scanning area.
- **Write Error?** Some tags may be read-only or locked. Try a new tag if necessary.
- **Tag Doesnâ€™t Trigger?** Check if your phoneâ€™s NFC reader is working by testing a different tag.

---

## Conclusion
With **NFC Tools**, writing data to NFC tags is a simple process. Whether you're automating tasks, sharing contact details, or linking to websites, NFC tags offer a convenient way to store and trigger digital actions with a single tap. Try experimenting with different record types to explore the full potential of NFC technology!
